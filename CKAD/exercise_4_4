# Create and work with labels. We will understand how the deployment, replicaSet, and pod labels interact.
kubectl create deployment design2 --image=nginx

# SELECTOR should be app=design2
kubectl get deployments.apps design2 -o wide

# Using selector -l
kubectl get -l app=design2 pod

# 
kubectl get --selector app=design2 pod -o yaml

# Edit the pod label from design2 to orange
kubectl edit pod design2-766d48574f-fxx4s

# Still one pod in the deployment
kubectl get deployments.apps design2 -o wide

# Should be two pods (one you edited, one deployment recreated)
kubectl get pods | grep design2

# Delete the deployment and you'll find that the pod whose label edited remains
kubectl delete deployment design2
kubectl get pods | grep design2
